[ Requirement ]

A part of view inside of UIScrollView should become sticky header when it reaches the top of screen. 
In this case, we will say the second view inside of the scroll view will become sticky when it reaches the top.

[ Auto layout Solution ]

Step 1: Make a sticky header view
set up shadowOffset/ shadowRadius / shadowColor

Step 2: Add the view you want to be sticky into the StickyHeaderView

Step 3: Layout

	The key of layout we have to ensure the topAnchor of the stickyHeaderView is greater that the topAnchor of View and greater then the bottomAnchor of its previous view

	********************************************************
	stickyHeaderView.topAnchor.constraint(greaterThanOrEqualTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor)
    stickyHeaderView.topAnchor.constraint(greaterThanOrEqualTo: firstView.bottomAnchor)
    ********************************************************

Step 4: Observer the scroll content offset
	
	We need to know the height of first View, when the contentOffSet is greater than the it, we need to set
	the Shadow Oppacity with a value. When the offSet is smaller than the height of first view, we set the Oppacity back to zero
